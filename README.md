# Lung-cancer CT segmentation & tumor growth tracking (NCI Imaging Data Commons)

Reproducible notebooks for organ and tumor segmentation on public lung-cancer CT from the
[NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/), using
[`idc-index`](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/idc-index) for data access — no authentication
required. The work compares an off-the-shelf segmentation model against the expert and AI
segmentations that ship with the data, and demonstrates longitudinal tumor-volume tracking across a
therapy window.

> **Data licensing:** the imaging data is **not** redistributed here — the notebooks download it on
> demand via `idc-index`. The NSCLC-Radiomics series used is **CC BY-NC 3.0 (non-commercial only)**.

## Notebooks

### 1. `organ_segmentation.ipynb` — organ & tumor segmentation comparison (primary)

Single-timepoint analysis of NSCLC-Radiomics patient **LUNG1-133** (chest CT, 184 axial slices).

- **Loads** the DICOM series with SimpleITK.
- **Segments** heart, aorta, lung, and trachea with [**TotalSegmentator**](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator)
  (pretrained 3D nnU-Net), merging the five lung lobes into one lung.
- **Interactive viewer** (ipywidgets): scroll slices, switch CT windows, toggle each organ overlay.
- **Compares** TotalSegmentator against the segmentations IDC ships for this patient (*AI nnU-Net SEG*) in three configs (`2d`, `3d_lowres`, `3d_fullres`): compared performance of 4 models at three organs that all models shared (i.e. heart, aorta, trachea). In case of the *lung*, TotalSegmentator performance was compared to that of the expert-curated segmentation (**expert SEG**).
- **Dice agreement** across all 4 models, plus inter-model variability analysis (cross-architecture
  vs within-architecture config spread).
- **Tumor (GTV)** quantification from the expert SEG: GTV volume and GTV-to-lung ratio (I did this just for fun honestly).
- A static overlay montage tool for figures.

**Headline results (LUNG1-133):**

| Structure | TotalSeg vs reference (Dice) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------------|-------|
| trachea   | 0.90–0.92 (vs nnU-Net)       | highest match due to air-filled structure (sharp boundary) |
| aorta     | 0.82–0.84 (vs nnU-Net)       | most volume spread across models (CV ~14%) |
| heart     | 0.79 (vs nnU-Net)            | fuzzy soft-tissue boundary |
| lung      | **0.974** (vs expert SEG)    | nnU-Net OAR models don't include lung |

Within one architecture (nnU-Net 2D/3D-lowres/3D-fullres) Dice is ~0.95–0.97 — i.e. **architecture
choice matters more than configuration.** Tumor (expert GTV): **1.40 mL, ~0.024% of lung volume.** I would guess stage 1 Lung cancer diagnosis for this patient, although tumor size is not the sole factor to consider.

### 2. `therapyNgrowthtracking/tumor_growth_tracking.ipynb` — longitudinal growth rate

Double-timepoint analysis of patient **PD-1-Lung-00001** in **`anti_pd_1_lung`** immunotherapy collection (two CT timepoints 57 days apart, segmentation restricted to *AIMI lung and nodule AI segmentation* as the only shared segmentation model at both timepoints).

- Downloads all CT timepoints (day 0, 57) + tumor segmentations; reads per-scan acquisition dates/times.
- Measures GTV at each timepoint and computes **interval, % change, specific growth rate, and volume
  doubling time (VDT)**.
- Result: GTV falls **1.86 mL → 0.70 mL (−62.5%) over 57 days** (VDT −40 d) — a volumetric treatment
  response approaching (but below) the RECIST-equivalent partial-response threshold.

\* `organ_segmentation.ipynb` has since been edited by hand and is the canonical version; re-running
`build_seg_notebook.py` regenerates the original scaffold, not the hand-edited notebook.

Downloaded DICOM (`data/`, `therapyNgrowthtracking/data/`), the venv, and large `.nii.gz` volumes are
gitignored — they are reproducible by re-running the notebooks.

## Setup

Requires **Python ≥ 3.10** (`idc-index` requirement) and `pydicom < 3` (for `pydicom-seg`); `torch`
needs `numpy < 2`. The repo was developed with a Python 3.12 environment created via
[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .idc-venv
VIRTUAL_ENV=.idc-venv uv pip install \
  idc-index SimpleITK nibabel matplotlib "ipywidgets>=8" \
  totalsegmentator pydicom-seg "numpy<2" "pydicom<3" \
  jupyter ipykernel nbformat nbconvert

# register the kernel used by the notebooks
.idc-venv/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name idc-venv \
  --display-name "Python 3 (.idc-venv)"
```

(Or `pip install` the same packages into any Python ≥ 3.10 environment.)

## Usage

```bash
.idc-venv/bin/jupyter lab organ_segmentation.ipynb
```

Select the **"Python 3 (.idc-venv)"** kernel and *Run All*. The notebooks download the required series
from IDC automatically (first TotalSegmentator run also downloads model weights). The interactive
sliders/overlays only respond in a live kernel — a statically executed notebook shows the rendered
outputs but not the widgets.

## Tools & data

- **Data:** NCI Imaging Data Commons (v24), collections `nsclc_radiomics` and `anti_pd_1_lung`.
- **Access:** `idc-index` (local DuckDB metadata index + public-bucket downloads, no auth).
- **Organ segmentation:** TotalSegmentator (pretrained nnU-Net).
- **Reference segmentations:** expert GTV/OAR + IDC AI nnU-Net annotations shipped with the data.
